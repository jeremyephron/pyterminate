## Why does this exist?

There are currently two builtin modules for handling termination behavior
in Python: [`atexit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html) and
[`signal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html). However, using them
directly leads to a lot of repeated boilerplate code, and some non-obvious
behaviors that can be easy to accidentally get wrong, which is why I wrote this
package.

The `atexit` module is currently insufficient since it fails to handle signals.
The `signal` module is currently insufficient since it fails to handle normal
or exception-caused exits.

Typical approaches would include frequently repeated code registering a
function both with `atexit` and on desired signals. However, extra care
sometimes needs to be taken to ensure the function doesn't run twice (or is
idempotent), and that a previously registered signal handler gets called.

## What can it do?

This packages does or allows the following behavior:

- Register a function to be called on program termination
    - Always on normal or exception-caused termination: `@pyterminate.register`
    - Configurable for any desired signals:<br/>
      `@pyterminate.register(signals=(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIGABRT))`

- Allows multiple functions to be registered

- Will call previous registered signal handlers

- Allows zero or non-zero exit codes on captured signals:<br/>
  `@pyterminate.register(successful_exit=True)`

- Allows suppressing or throwing of `KeyboardInterrupt` on `SIGINT`:<br/>
  `@pyterminate.register(keyboard_interrupt_on_sigint=True)`
    - You may want to throw a `KeyboardInterrupt` if there is additional
      exception handling defined.

- Allows functions to be unregistered: `pyterminate.unregister(func)`

- Ignore requested signals while registered function is executing, ensuring
  that it is not interrupted.
  - It's important to note that `SIGKILL` and calls to `os._exit()` cannot be
    ignored.

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyterminate
```

```python3
import signal

import pyterminate


@pyterminate.register(
    args=(None,),
    kwargs={"b": 42},
    signals=(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIGTERM),
    successful_exit=True,
    keyboard_interrupt_on_sigint=True
)
def cleanup(*args, **kwargs):
    ...

# or

pyterminate.register(cleanup, ...)
```

## Tips and tricks

### Multiprocessing start method

When starting processes with Python's
[`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
module, the `fork` method will fail to call registered functions on exit, since
the process is ended with `os._exit()` internally, which bypasses all cleanup
and immediately kills the process.

One way of getting around this are using the `"spawn"` start method if that
is acceptable for your application. Another method is to register your function
to a user-defined signal, and wrap your process code in try-except block,
raising the user-defined signal at the end. `pyterminate` provides this
functionality in the form of the `exit_with_signal` decorator, which simply
wraps the decorated function in a try-finally block, and raises the given
signal. Example usage:

```python3
import multiprocessing as mp
import signal

import pyterminate


@pyterminate.exit_with_signal(signal.SIGUSR1)
def run_process():

    @pyterminate.register(signals=[signal.SIGUSR1, signal.SIGINT, signal.SIGTERM])
    def cleanup():
        ...

    ...


if __name__ == "__main__"
    mp.set_start_method("fork")

    proc = mp.Process(target=run_process)
    proc.start()

    try:
        proc.join(timeout=300)
    except TimeoutError:
        proc.terminate()
        proc.join()
```
